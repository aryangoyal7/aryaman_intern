System Design Overview
The Chat Application is built on a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, providing a robust and real-time messaging experience for users. The system architecture revolves around several key components:

Backend Server (Node.js & Express.js):

The backend server handles HTTP requests and responses, implementing various API endpoints for user authentication, chat creation, messaging, and group management.
Express.js, a minimalist web framework for Node.js, is utilized for routing and handling API requests.
Database (MongoDB & Mongoose ODM):

MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is employed to store user data, chat information, and messages. It provides flexibility and scalability for managing large volumes of data.
Mongoose ODM (Object Data Modeling) is used to interact with MongoDB, providing a schema-based solution for modeling application data.
Frontend (React.js & Redux):

The frontend is developed using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React components enable the creation of a dynamic and responsive user interface.
Redux, a state management library, is integrated to manage the application's state, ensuring consistent data flow and state synchronization across components.
Real-Time Communication (Socket.io):

Socket.io is employed to enable real-time bidirectional event-based communication. It facilitates instant message delivery and updates, ensuring a seamless chat experience for users.
Socket.io enables features such as real-time message synchronization and dynamic user presence indicators.
Authentication and Security:

User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), providing secure access to protected routes and ensuring user identity verification.
Passwords are encrypted using Bcrypt.js, enhancing security by hashing user passwords before storing them in the database.
User Management and Search:

The system includes user management functionalities, allowing users to register, log in, and manage their profiles.
User search is implemented, enabling users to find and connect with others based on their names or email addresses.
Group Chat Functionality:

Users can create group chats, invite members, and manage group chat settings.
Group chat features include renaming chats, adding or removing users, and dynamic updates to group member lists.
